My AI/ML & Web Development Projects
Welcome to my project showcase! This repository features a collection of my work in Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and web development, primarily focusing on tools and systems built during my internship at Hudini. These projects highlight my capabilities in AI integration, data pipelines, and scalable tool development.

1. AI-Powered RAG System for Hotel Data
Description: Developed a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed to provide intelligent and data-driven responses by querying a proprietary hotel database. This system significantly enhances the accuracy and relevance of information retrieval.

Key Features:

Intelligent querying from a proprietary hotel database.

Leverages large language models for context-aware response generation.

Efficient semantic search capabilities.

Technologies Used: Python, Phi-3 AI Model, Google Colab, FAISS Vector Database, LLMs (for text generation/understanding).

2. Real-time Weather Forecasting Tool
Description: Designed and deployed a dynamic weather forecasting application, capable of integrating real-time API data to provide accurate and context-aware weather updates.

Key Features:

Real-time data integration for up-to-date forecasts.

Dynamic querying capabilities.

Intelligent response generation via an LLM.

Technologies Used: MCP Server Framework, Real-time APIs, Claude LLM.

3. Hotel Data Integration & Analytics Solution
Description: A project focused on building robust data pipelines for hotel-related information. Initially integrated data from static JSON files, then evolved to connect with live APIs from an analytics database, providing real-time insights.

Key Features:

Seamless integration of diverse data sources (static JSON, live APIs).

Enables real-time data insights.

Scalable data handling for analytics.

Technologies Used: Python, JSON, Live APIs, Analytics Databases.

4. Python-based Web Scraper with Vector Database Integration
Description: Developed a custom web scraper to efficiently gather web content, enhanced by integrating with a vector database for advanced content retrieval based on contextual similarity.

Key Features:

Automated web content extraction.

Semantic content search capabilities.

Improved relevance in information retrieval.

Technologies Used: Python, Vector Database, Web Scraping Libraries.
